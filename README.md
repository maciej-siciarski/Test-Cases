## **Test-case documentation**

Test-case documentation provides instructions for testing specific software functionalities or scenarios, aims to maintain testing consistency, monitor progress effectively, and assist in identifying and resolving potential issues. Constructed from basic elements such as:

- **Title**
  
It accurately specifies the functionality being tested, providing clear insight into the particular aspect that the test case is addressing.<br>
<br>

-  **Description**

The test case description offers a more thorough explanation of the functionality being examined, which the test case seeks to verify.<br>

-  **Preconditions**
  
Before initiating the test case execution process, it's essential to ensure that prerequisite conditions are fulfilled; failure to do so may result in unexpected inconsistencies.<br>

-  **Input**
  
The input for each test case may vary depending on the specific functionality being tested. This may include user input, system configurations, or predefined data sets.<br>

-  **Steps**
  
Each test case consists of a series of steps to be followed in order to execute the test scenario. These steps are designed to exercise the functionality being tested thoroughly.<br>

- **Expected Results**
  
The expected results for each test case describe the desired outcome or behaviour of the software application after executing the test steps. These expectations serve as a benchmark for determining whether the test has passed or failed.<br>

- **Steps with Corresponding Expected Results**
  
The presentation of expected outcomes can differ based on project requirements, available resources, or project deadlines. As a result, the level of detail in test cases may vary, ranging from high-level to low-level.<br>
